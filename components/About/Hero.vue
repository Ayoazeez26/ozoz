              Ozoz Sokoh is a food explorer, educator, budding curator, and
              Traveler By Plate, for whom "Food Is More Than Eating". In 2009,
              she began journaling about food on her blog, Kitchen Butterfly. In
              2013, she created the
              <span class="font-semibold">#NewNigerianKitchen</span>, developing
              her philosophy and practice with Nigerian food. Also central to
              her work is connectedness through food, from food sovereignty,
              cultural identity, reclamation of food systems and importantly,
              the joy of eating.

              Her research and documentation explore the roots of Nigerian and
              West African cuisine, the impact of West African intellectual
              contributions to global development from the American South,
              through the Caribbean to Europe and Latin America, and the
              connection to the Afro-diaspora.
